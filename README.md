# Stadia-ViGEm

XBox360 controller emulation for Stadia controller. Supports multiple devices and vibration. Forked from Mi-ViGEm (https://github.com/grayver/Mi-ViGEm) by grayver.
XBox360 emulation driver is provided by ViGEm (https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus), by Benjamin HÃ¶glinger.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 (should work on Windows 7 and 8 also)
- ViGEm bus installed (can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases))

## How it works
Stadia-ViGEm program at start scans for Stadia Controllers and then proxies found Stadia Controllers to virtual XBox360 gamepads (with help of ViGEmBus). Also Stadia-ViGEm subscribes to system device plug/unplug notifications and rescan devices on each notification.
All found devices are displayed in tray icon context menu. Manual device rescan can be initiated via tray icon context menu.
